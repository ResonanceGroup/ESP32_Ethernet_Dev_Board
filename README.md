This project is meant to test 2 different ethernet controller chips for the ESP32. The board is testing the W5100S and W5500. Only populate one or the other. Feel free to use this schematic as a reference. Or make your dev board that includes the ethernet controllers. If referencing off of the schematic, please provide credit to the original project (this one).

Will update later which circuit performed the best.
